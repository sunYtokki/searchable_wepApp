It also doesn’t hurt that Bowery Ballroom is smack in the middle of the food and drink hub of the Lower East Side, providing fantastic options for pre- and post- show fun.",

It’s somehow maintained this cred despite ditching its independence in 2017 to team up with promoter Live Nation under the Mercury East banner (which also includes the Bowery Ballroom). Fantastic programming and cheap ticket prices still draw fans to the small, barebones room, show after show",

Hidden inside an old building facing the elevated JMZ train, Market Hotel could be easy to miss if it weren’t for the gaggle of concert-goers smoking out front. Originally an artists-in-residence space when it opened in 2008, Market Hotel endured a shutdown and renovations before reopening as a concert hall in 2015. Its unique history and commitment to curating talent with cult-like followings helps the smaller spot retain its underground vibe. The room’s odd V shape doesn’t hinder dancing or crowd surfing, and it’s a feeling like no other when the rickety floor shakes from both the bass and the trains passing through the nearby Myrtle-Broadway station.",

A wide variety of food options and an entertaining in-game experience. The court looks very nice as well, especially with the new grey colors. The angling of the upper level provides a clear view of the action, even from the highest rows. Overall, a clean, modern arena that felt like a lounge from the moment I walked inside. Convenient subway exit right in front of the arena too. My primary critique would be the incredibly small distance between rows of seats on the upper level, it was difficult to maneuver even with people standing out of the way. I understand the need to hold more people, but a little more room would be nice. Otherwise, I definitely look forward to returning to Barclays Center in the future for another basketball game, maybe even making it a yearly tradition."

        "description": "Built in 1886, Webster Hall has been through several iterations (and names) before settling into its tenure as a high-caliber concert venue. In the 1950s, performers like Tito Puente and Woody Guthrie graced the stage, and when it was known as The Ritz in the '80s, the same venue hosted rock legends like U2, Eric Clapton and Guns N' Roses. These days, you can expect to find indie acts like Animal Collective and The Maine, as well as hip-hop artists like Wiz Khalifa and Mobb Deep. Just be sure to show up early if you want a decent view.",

They have a nice lounge area near the entrance/exit where you can enjoy some drinks and snacks at the bar before heading upstairs to the main stage areas.  There are bars scattered everywhere throughout so you will never go thirsty ;)"

                "review": "Mixed feelings about this place. Pros: Large venue with freedom to roam the floor or the balcony. Lounge/ bar area downstairs by the bathrooms where you can still hear the music and watch from screens. Average beer prices. Good sound and light production. Security thoroughness is average. Good location, easy to get to.Cons: Excruciating lines. I have been stuck in entry lines that wrap around the block, even an hour+ after doors opened. THEN once inside, I had to wait almost 40 minutes to check my coat. It seems like their staff/ organization is just really sloppy. I've also had experiences where staff is very short-tempered and rude, either yelling or pushing past, unprovoked."

                "review": "One of the best concert venues in New York because they truly customize the experience to each artist and bring in the best acts. The entire place is newly renovated and easy to navigate. I'm tall, so I don't mind the standing room only, but I have seen shorter people get annoyed when they have to jockey for space to see the stage. Will be going back soon!"
